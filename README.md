[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-search-service)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-search-service)

## Local Development

### Required Tools

- Docker with docker-compose

### Development environment

Use docker compose commands to build/start/stop the service locally e.g. `docker compose up --build` or `make up` will rebuild and start the service.

By default the local URL is http://localhost:8000/services/search-service, where `/services/search-service` is configured by the `PATH_PREFIX` ENV variable.

### Tests

Run `make unit-test` to execute the test suites and output code coverage for each
package. Most of the tests aren't dependent on external services, these can be
run using `go test -short ./...`.

Run `make go-lint` to execute linting checks, including [Golang Security Checker](https://github.com/securego/gosec)

#### End-to-end tests

End-to-end tests are executed as part of the `make unit-test` command.

Generally they sit in `main_test.go`. The test suite will start up the search service in a go-routine to run tests against it, and therefore all ENV variables required for configuring the service have to be set prior to running the test suite. This is all automated with the `make unit-test` command.

#### Pact provider tests

To run the Pact provider-side tests:

```
# if you want to test your local branch, do this first,
# otherwise the latest production image for the search service might be used
docker compose build search-service

# to run the Pact tests
make provider-pact
```

If you want to run the tests against a specific version of the pact, you first need to find it. They are hosted on https://pact-broker.api.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/. The best way to find the right URL is to look at the build for Sirius (which publishes the pact via its consumer-side tests), in the "Backend Pact Unit Tests" task. You're looking for output like this (in the `make api-unit-pact` step):

```
Pact successfully published for sirius version 24f579d37f0615332bf3b0949cb2b6ee6bb2711d and provider search-service.

  View the published pact at https://pact-broker.api.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/pacts/provider/search-service/consumer/sirius/version/24f579d37f0615332bf3b0949cb2b6ee6bb2711d
```

Once you have this, edit the docker-compose.yml entry for pact-verifier to look like this:

```
pact-verifier:
  image: pactfoundation/pact-ref-verifier
  depends_on:
    - search-service
    - pact-provider-state-api
  entrypoint:
    - pact_verifier_cli
    - --hostname=search-service
    - --port=8000
    - --base-path=/services/search-service/
    - --header=${PACT_HEADER}
    - --loglevel=debug
    - --state-change-url=http://pact-provider-state-api:5175/provider_state_change
    - --state-change-teardown
    #- --broker-url=https://pact-broker.api.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/
    #- --provider-name=search-service
    - --url=https://pact-broker.api.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/pacts/provider/search-service/consumer/sirius/version/b1a180aa83e2765e9ff2c22d6292bdd8662f961d
```

i.e. comment out `--broker-url` and `--provider` and use `--url` instead, pasting in the URL you found from the build logs.

## Formatting

This project uses the standard Golang styleguide, and can be autoformatting by running `gofmt -s -w .`.

## Changing the index definition

The index config is defined in <person/person.go>. When the definition is
changed:
- the service will create a new index
- normal indexing operations will then act on _both_ indices
- `index` command operation will act on the new index only
- search operations will continue to use the old index (because the alias will
  not be changed automatically)

When the new index has been filled it can be activated by using the
`update-alias` command. It can be run with `-explain` first to show how the
aliases will be set.

Once you are satisfied that everything is working correctly the old index can be
removed by using the `cleanup-indices` command. It can be run with `-explain`
first to show the indices to be deleted.

## Swagger docs

Run `make docs` or `make swagger-up` to view swagger docs at http://localhost:8383/

#### Updating swagger docs

Run `make swagger-generate` to update the [docs/openapi/openapi.yml](docs/openapi/openapi.yml) file

The search service uses [Go Swagger](https://goswagger.io/) to generate the specification file from annotations in the code itself. See [main.go](main.go) for examples. [Go Swagger](https://goswagger.io/) is based on [Swagger 2.0](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/). Be careful not to confuse it with OpenAPI v3.

Another gotcha... Make sure annotations are written with 2 space tabs in order for the parser to work correctly!
